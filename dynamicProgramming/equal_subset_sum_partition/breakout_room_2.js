/**
 * Given a set of positive numbers
 * find if we can partition it into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both the subsets is equal.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: {1, 2, 3, 4}
 * Output: true
 * The given set can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum: {1, 4} & {2, 3}
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: {1, 1, 3, 4, 7}
 * Output: True
 * The given set can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum: {1, 3, 4} & {1, 7}
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: {2, 3, 4, 6}
 * Output: false
 * The given set cannot be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum.
