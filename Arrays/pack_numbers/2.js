Pack numbers

Given an array of integers, write a method that will pack neighbouring numbers that are the same into the string X:N, where X is the integer value

and N is the sequence length.

Example:

packNumbers ((5, 5, 5, 7, 1, 3, 4, 7])

should return

[5:3', 7.2', 3, 4, 7]


packNumbers ((5, 5, 5, 7, 1, 3, 4, 7, 5])

should return

[5:3', 7.2', 3, 4, 7, 5]
