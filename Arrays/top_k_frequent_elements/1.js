/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/
 * 
 * Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
 * Output: [1,2]
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [1], k = 1
 * Output: [1]
 * 
 * Note:
 * You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
 * Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
 * It's guaranteed that the answer is unique, in other words the set of the top k frequent elements is unique.
 * You can return the answer in any order.
